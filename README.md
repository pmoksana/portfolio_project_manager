### About Me

 I don't just manage projects; I drive them. I thrive on collaborating with diverse teams to set the strategic direction for engineering initiatives. 
I'm the point of contact for our customers throughout the entire project and I'm the bridge between customer requirements and the tech project team
In close cooperation with the specialist departments, I'm analyse and specify the customer's requirements and value
I  ensure the project quality through continuous control, analysis, monitoring and reporting of the projects
I empower the team to make quality a continuous exercise in analysis and control. 
                This way, I don't just report, but we build a lasting quality foundation for the project

Key Responsibilities and Contributions:
           
             I manage backlog evolution by serving as the prioritization bridge between the Product Owner's vision, through close collaboration with stakeholders and the technical team's capacity.
            This involves using data-driven techniques (like impact vs. effort analysis) to ensure our evolving requirements always target the optimal outcome
            I also handle staffing and resource allocation to ensure teams have what they need to succeed. 
            I believe in proactive communication, and I make it a point to keep all stakeholders, including senior management, informed on project status and key milestones.
As a strategic PM, my mission is simple: Empower the team to embed continuous improvement, resulting in superior user solutions that directly fuel business growth
                
        

### Soft skils:
* 🔹 Facilitate key Agile ceremonies and guide the team in applying Scrum values, ensuring we’re not just doing Agile, but being Agile
* 🔹 Co-create roadmaps and delivery plans based on team capacity, product goals, and metrics — balancing the short-term sprint rhythm with the big-picture strategy
* 🔹 Write epics, user stories, and requirements that help align dev work with business value
* 🔹 Support the Product Owner in backlog prioritization, refinement, and stakeholder alignment
* 🔹 Foster team connection and psychological safety through regular 1:1s, retrospectives, and open conversations — because delivery follows trust
* 🔹 Track risks, dependencies, and delivery health — and proactively course-correct when needed

📈 What’s worked well and shown good results:
* 🔸 Created onboarding flows for new engineers that reduced ramp-up time and improved retention
* 🔸 Introduced metrics-driven planning and delivery retrospectives that helped teams improve sprint-over-sprint
* 🔸 Established a shared understanding of the product vision and technical roadmap between devs, POs, and stakeholders
* 🔸 Facilitated dozens of retrospectives and feedback loops to help teams reflect and continuously evolve
