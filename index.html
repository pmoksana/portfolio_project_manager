                I don't just manage projects; I drive them. I thrive on collaborating with diverse teams to set the strategic direction for engineering initiatives. 
I'm the point of contact for our customers throughout the entire project and I'm the bridge between customer requirements and the tech project team
In close cooperation with the specialist departments, I'm analyse and specify the customer's requirements and value
I  ensure the project quality through continuous control, analysis, monitoring and reporting of the projects
I empower the team to make quality a continuous exercise in analysis and control. 
                My approach are:

Focus on Strategic Outcome:

I don't just report status; we build a lasting, strategic quality foundation that ensures the project's long-term success.

Focus on Collaborative Ownership:

By empowering the team, we shift from simple status reporting to co-creating a deep, lasting quality foundation for every project deliverable."

Short and Punchy:

My approach moves beyond reporting â€” we collaboratively engineer a foundation for sustainable, long-term project quality.

            <p>
             I manage backlog evolution by serving as the prioritization bridge between the Product Owner's vision, through close collaboration with stakeholders and the technical team's capacity.
            This involves using data-driven techniques (like impact vs. effort analysis) to ensure our evolving requirements always target the optimal outcome
            I also handle staffing and resource allocation to ensure teams have what they need to succeed. 
                
            I believe in proactive communication, and I make it a point to keep all stakeholders, including senior management, informed on project status and key milestones.
As a strategic PM, my mission is simple: Empower the team to embed continuous improvement, resulting in superior user solutions that directly fuel business growth
