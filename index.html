            <h2>Agile Project Manager, Scrum Master and Data Enthusiast</h2>
            
            <p class="intro">
                I'm an Agile Project Manager and Certified Scrum Master who is passionately self-learning AI and Data Science to drive data-informed decisions and shape the next generation of engineering initiatives
           </p>
            <p class="intro">
                I don't just manage projects; I drive them. I thrive on collaborating with diverse teams to set the strategic direction for engineering initiatives.
                I'm the bridge between customer requirements and the technical project team, analyzing and specifying customer value in close cooperation with specialist departments.
            
                I empower the team to make quality a continuous exercise in analysis and control. 
                   
                  My approach moves beyond reporting — we collaboratively engineer a foundation for sustainable, long-term project quality.

            <p>
                I manage backlog evolution by serving as the "prioritization bridge" between the Product Owner's vision, through close collaboration with stakeholders, and the technical team's capacity.
                This involves using data-driven techniques (like impact vs. effort analysis) to ensure our evolving requirements always target the optimal outcome. 
                I also handle staffing and resource allocation to ensure teams have what they need to succeed.
            </p>
            <p>
                I believe in proactive communication, and Agile values. I make it a point to keep all stakeholders, including senior management, informed on project status and key milestones. 
                As a strategic PM, my mission is simple: Empower the team to embed continuous improvement, resulting in superior user solutions that directly fuel business growth.
            </p>
